# pkmnDiscordBot

Discord Bot used to automate and manage competitive Pok√©mon Draft Leagues.

Tested on Python 3.5+

To set up the bot, you need to register a new bot on the Discord app page, get a token, etc. There are plenty of guides for this available. The token will be used to connect the bot to your server. You must edit pkmnDraftBot.py with your token -- the location is marked clearly within the source.

The app and supporting data file (pkmnDraftBot.py, pkmnList.txt) must be placed in a directory together. The Python app needs to run indefinitely,as long as the draft is running. I would recommend using `screen` or `nohup` to accomplish this.


In the event that the bot crashes due to Discord outages/hiccups, simply restart the app; your draft will be able to resume from its previous position. These issues are thankfully infrequent enough that this shouldn't be an issue.
